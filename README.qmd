title: "ASC Training"
format: gfm
---

This repo is a collection of training resources for students working on projects at the [Analytics Solutions Center](https://huntsman.usu.edu/asc/) (ASC). The ASC collaborates with sponsor organizations to provide students at the [Jon M. Huntsman School of Business](https://huntsman.usu.edu), and [Utah State University](https://www.usu.edu) generally, with real-world experiences working on data-related projects. Each ASC project is mentored by a faculty member from the [Data Analytics and Information Systems Department](https://huntsman.usu.edu/dais/). The following training is provided for students on projects that I mentor, in conjunction with repositories using my [asc-template](https://github.com/marcdotson/asc-template).

## Python

Installing Python locally (i.e., on your computer), along with maintaining a reproducible environment, can be challenging for even advanced users. As immortalized by XKCD:

<p align="center">
<img src="figures/xkcd_python-env.png" width="400">
</p>

An environment is composed of the Python, libraries, and library dependencies used for a given project. What makes an environment reproducible is keeping track of *which* version of the Python, libraries, and library dependencies we're using for a given project. While "keeping track" could happen in many different ways, ideally we want to keep track of our environment such that it can be easily *reproduced* on another machine, by you (including future you) or someone else. For our purposes, we need to be sure that everyone working on our ASC project, including anyone at the sponsor organization, can easily reproduce our environment and run the associated code.

Python is a big tent, and there are many ways to manage an environment. I recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install and maintain Python versions and [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to keep track of the version of the libraries and library dependencies within our project's reproducible environment.

### pyenv

We need to keep track of which version of Python we're using for a number of reasons. Here's two:

- Not all Python versions are (or were) backwards compatible (i.e., if someone runs our code with a different version of Python, it might not work).
- Python comes pre-installed on many operating systems since some of the actual operating system uses that specific version of Python. This is a version *should not be used* for any project work.

For these and other reasons (if not the last one alone), we need the ability to maintain multiple versions of Python on the same computer. [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is a Python version management tool that is designed to be as *simple* as possible. Though what constitutes "simple" is a matter of experience and your mileage may vary.

::: {.callout-tip title="Using the Command Line"}
While pyenv is simple, it will require you to use the command line (i.e., terminal or shell). Be patient and *take your time* walking carefully through the [installation instructions](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). Daniel Chen, who introduced me to pyenv, also has a [great write-up](https://chendaniely.github.io/python_setup/210-python_install.html) of the installation instructions that may be a bit easier to follow. A few things to help as you install:

- The command line is the programming interface into your operating system itself. You don't have to know everything about it to follow instructions.
- When you get to the section [Set up your shell environment for pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#b-set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv), the instructions are different based on the *type* of command line. If you're on a Mac that's running macOS Catalina 10.15.7 or later, the terminal is Zsh. If you're using Linux, the shell is Bash (and you probably already know that). And if you're using Windows, you'll be using the [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) fork with PowerShell.
:::

Now that you have pyenv installed, you can install and manage all the versions of Python on your computer. To see what versions you already have installed, on the command line, run `pyenv versions`. At first this is probably just the system version. Note that if you've installed Python before pyenv, it won't be listed: `pyenv versions` will only list the system version and any additional versions you install using pyenv. To see all the available versions of Python that you can install, run `pyenv install --list`. This can be overwhelming, but a good place to start is the latest version of Python that has a stable release (i.e., doesn't have a `-dev` tag). For example, to install Python 3.12.4, run `pyenv install 3.12.4`.

Remember how you shouldn't use the operating system version of Python? You can set the default version of Python that you'll use (leaving the operating system to do it's own thing). For example, to set Python 3.12.4 as the default global version, run `pyenv global 3.12.4`. If you run `pyenv versions` again you should see an asterisk by the global default you specified.

There's a lot more that [pyenv can do](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/), but now you should at least be set to safely manage and use Python.

### venv

Why do we need to track the versions of the libraries and library dependencies we use?

- Libraries change. Functions, methods, and parameters get modified or deprecated.
- Just because our project code works now doesn't mean that it will work for someone else or in the future.

Ensuring our project environment is reproducible enables collaboration, future-proofing, and open science.

By default, all libraries are installed in a single, global library known as the *system library*. What we need is a *project library*. This helps highlight an important feature of reproducible environments: Each project will have its own project library and thus be *isolated*. If two projects use different versions of the same package, they won't conflict with each other because they'll each have their own project library. Well, not *exactly*. Python employs a global cache to avoid having to install the version of a given library more than once. (Note that if you've installed Python prior to using pyenv, you may have a global cache that is borked. You can run `pip cache purge` in the command line to start fresh.)

The [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) library comes pre-installed with Python as the default reproducible (or *virtual*, hence the v in venv) environment management tool. It works in two steps. First, we must create a project library. Second, we keep track of the versions of the libraries and library dependencies that we use. However, the easiest way to implement our reproducible environment will require two additional tools: an IDE and version control.

## Positron

A reliable integrated development environment (IDE) is arguably your most important tool as a data analyst or data engineer. There are many options, but I recommend [Positron](https://positron.posit.co), a next-generation data science IDE. Built on VS Code's [open source core](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), Positron combines the multilingual extensibility of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with essential data tools common to language-specific IDEs.

![](figures/positron-logo.png){width=40% fig-align="right"}

- Why do I have to save a file before I can open another? Is it the same file type? Some preference I can overwrite?
- What about rainbow parentheses and indentations? Is that an extension?

## Using GitHub

::: {.callout-caution}
Some of the following GitHub details include instructions that are RStudio-specific. I am working on generalizing this to [Positron](https://positron.posit.co) for use with both R and Python.
:::

GitHub is a powerful collaboration and version control tool. We will be using it for *project management*, *writing*, and *coding*.

### Project Management

By project management I primarily mean keeping track of assigned tasks using GitHub's **Issues**. We can have an ongoing conversation there about each specific issue and close it out when its completed or resolved. Be sure to tag collaborators you want to see the conversation (e.g., `@marcdotson`). Think of this as an email thread or Slack channel except all of the conversations are in one place, easily searchable, and automatically archived.

### Writing

Think of using GitHub to collaborate on writing as using something like Google Docs. It is essential that we document what we're doing in each project as we do it. This is true for a number of reasons.

1. Writing forces you to think clearly about what you're doing.
2. If you're coding, think of the associated writing as long-form comments.
3. The final product of any project is going to be a paper, so start writing it now.

GitHub supports **Markdown** syntax, which you're probably more familiar with than you might expect from time spent with **Quarto**. We will be writing using *parameterized* Quarto documents so we can easily reference model output instead of including it manually. See below for more on using Quarto.

### Coding

GitHub was created for software development. While we may not actually be developing software, we will be importing, wrangling, visualizing, and modeling data using code, and it's going to be essential for everyone to be on the same page. Even if you were just working solo, you will be collaborating with your past self and you should do yourself a favor and impose good version controls on your code.

### Set-Up

To get started, complete Jenny Bryan's [pre-workshop set-up](https://happygitwithr.com/workshops.html?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiT1RVelptVTNZams0T0dZMiIsInQiOiJlR0orVlVpaHZsRlwveWh5QUJPN2U1Q3BcL0pHVHo5RXJ5UkhabFlwVXM4NlEwcHhRTENQZmVxaEEyNnVLSkRFTTdVa0hyNjk4MkFHYUU1Nkt5VXNtRm9heFM3N3dnUFplZ1V5anpRTWdnWDVscE1lOUR6VzBHaGFQOUFhOGd1QkN3In0=#pre-workshop-set-up). This can take up to a few hours, so plan accordingly. Note that the following Git and GitHub training draws heavily from Jenny Bryan's training on using Git and GitHub from rstudio::conf(2019).

### GitHub Basics

Now that you're set up, let's get started.

#### Just Once: Clone

First **clone** one of your repos, or a repo that you're a collaborator on. This is simply creating a local copy of the repo. You do this inside RStudio by creating a new project and selecting `Version Control > Git`.

![](figures/clone.png)

::: {.callout-note title="`.python-version`, `/.venv`, and `requirements.txt`"}
Just like we can specify a global default version of Python using pyenv, we can also specify a *local* default version of Python using pyenv as part of our reproducible environment. Note that this has already been done if the project repository was generated using my [asc-template](https://github.com/marcdotson/asc-template).

To create this on your own, or modify an existing `.python-version` file, after navigating to the project's working directory in the command line, you would run `pyenv local 3.12.4`, assuming you want Python 3.12.4 to be set as the default. This would create (or modify) a `.python-version` file in that directory that specifies the version of Python to use for that project.

First, it creates a project library (see `/.venv` below). Second, it maintains a file called `requirements.txt` listing all of the versions of the libaries and library dependencies you've installed in your project library. Here's how it works:

- To add all of these same libraries on a new machine, once you have the project working directory, simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Whenever you install new libraries or decide to update the versions of libraries you use, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to update `requirements.txt`.

The `requirements.txt` from venv file, along with the hidden `.python-version` file from pyenv, ensure that we have and can maintain a reproducible environment for our project.

Before the `requirements.txt` file can be created and updated, the project library itself needs to be generated. It is a hidden folder called `/.venv` that is not pushed to GitHub. Note that this has already been done if the project repository was generated using my [asc-template](https://github.com/marcdotson/asc-template).

To create this on your own, after navigating to your project's working directory in the command line, you would create the project library for your project by running `python -m venv .venv`. This would create a `/.venv` folder in the working directory.
:::

#### Daily Work: Commit, Push, Pull

Now you can open up the RStudio Project in the local, cloned repo and work on the project. You have a new Git pane in RStudio that notifies you that changes you've made means you are out-of-sync with the **remote** repo (i.e., the one on GitHub). Once you've made a number of changes, you click on the files you want to **commit** and click commit. Think of a commit as saving a snapshot of all of the changes you've made across these files all at once. Include a clear commit message. You'll do this fairly frequently for your local repo.

Eventually you'll be ready for other people to have access to your changes on the remote repo. To do this, you'll click on the green up arrow to **push** your changes to the remote repo. You push far less often than you commit, maybe once a work session, since this means you think it's ready for others to have access to. Each time you push, all of your commits are archived on the remote repo, including the **diff** or the side-by-side comparison of what changes you made to the previous version.

When you start a new work session, you'll want to click on the blue down arrow to **pull** the latest changes from the repo, possibly the work other collaborators have pushed, so you're synced. Note that hidden files (i.e., `.gitignore` and `.Rprofile`) may try to change on their own. When you open the commit dialog, you can click on these modified files and hit **revert** to undo these changes.

![](figures/daily-work.png)

#### Collaborating: Branches and Pull Requests

Because GitHub is very systematic in the way it manages commits, we will run into commit errors when multiple people have changed the same thing at the same time. To largely avoid this problem, among other things, we will be using **branches**. Each branch is a separate version of the repo that exists in parallel, one where you can make changes or experiment without it affecting the working or **main** branch. You should *never* push changes to the main branch directly.

To do your work as a collaborator, create a new branch on GitHub with a short, descriptive name specific to the issue you're working on (e.g., `paper-revision`). When you start a work session, make sure you select the branch you want to work on from the dropdown in the Git pane in RStudio. You can commit, push, and pull as usual to the branch you're working on. This will largely avoid commit errors because each collaborator on a project should be working on a different issue and likely a different branch. When you've completed work on the issue associated with the branch, create a **pull request** on GitHub and tag me (i.e., `@marcdotson`). This allows me to review what you've done, have a conversation with you about it, and eventually pull what you've done into the main branch. I'll then delete the branch specific to that issue. Rinse and repeat.

### Cleaning Up Branches

While your daily work won't require you to write any Git code, *eventually* you'll need to clean up the branches you have on your local clone. You'll need to do this from the command line Terminal. I recommend you use the one available in RStudio once you've opened the project you want to clean up.

- In the Terminal, type `git branch --merged` to see which branches have been merged into **main** and can be deleted from your local clone.
- Then type `git branch -d <branch>` where `<branch>` is replaced with the name of the merged branch that you'd like to remove from your clone.
- Finally, use `git fetch -p` to prune remote-tracking branches that are no longer on remote (i.e., on GitHub).

Voila! A cleaned up branch drop down in your Git pane makes things easier to navigate.

## Using Quarto

::: {.callout-caution}
The following Quarto details are written primarily for R users. I am working to generalize this for Pythonistas as well, including how Quarto differs from Jupyter Notebooks. See:

- [Quarto Gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/)
- [Introduction to Quarto](https://posit-conf-2024.github.io/quarto-intro/)
- [Build-a-Dashboard Workshop](https://posit-conf-2024.github.io/quarto-dashboards/)

Notes from the [Quarto Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=_VKxTPWDhA4) series:

- Bridge the gap between coding environments that you might enjoy and output formats that you need to produce results in to inform decision-making.
- Does Positron's base install now include Quarto or does it need to be added as an extension?
- Include a project format file in _quarto.yml to specify project: output-dir: folder-name. Also needed to set the working directory project: execute-dir: project.
- Note the Visual Editor as an option, especially for markdown syntax (hello tables and citations).
- quarto convert doc.qmd to convert a Quarto document into a Jupyter notebook and the render with quarto render doc.ipynb.
- Formatting with CSS-like divs and spans.
- Fenced div with layout?
- Parameters specified inside of a cell using #| or still in the YAML header itself? May be different for Python with "#| tags: [parameters]"
- Is there something as simple as requirements.txt for R packages?
- Pathlib or OS libraries?
- Reference Gallery.
- What about GitHub pages as a format for creating a source website that's hosted entirely on GitHub?
:::

Quarto is a powerful typesetting tool and the multilingual replacement for R Markdown. Instead of writing in Word or a Google Doc, by using Quarto we can include code blocks, parameterize the document to easily replicate reports, and output our work as Word documents, PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, HTML slide decks, GitHub pages, etc.

### Markdown

Markdown is a simple, generic typesetting syntax. Here are some [Markdown Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html). GitHub recognizes this syntax, including in Issues and pull requests.

### Code

Quarto allows us to include code blocks and output as part of the document. In other words, this is what we need to create reproducible reports. You can also include R, Python, C++, Stan, and other code blocks and output.

### Pandoc

Pandoc is the typesetting software behind the scenes that allows us to take a Quarto document and output it as nearly anything.

### Quarto Basics

#### YAML

The header at the top of any Quarto document is coded in **YAML** (i.e., Yet Another Markup Language), which follows a simple `key: value` syntax. For most Quarto documents in a project repo, you should set `format: gfm`. When you knit changes to your Quarto document, it will create a separate markdown document using "GitHub Flavored Markdown" that GitHub can parse. For example, the header for this document is:

```
---
title: "Research Assistant Training"
format: gfm
---
```

#### Parameters

Ever have to go through and manually change any data or model output referenced in a report? Not only is this costly and error prone, but it is the definition of non-reproducible. Parameters in Quarto help solve part of this problem.

Parameters are included as part of the header:

```
---
title: "Research Assistant Training"
format: gfm
params:
  name: "Analytics"
  data: "analytics_data.rds"
---
```

Parameter values can then be referenced in the report (including code blocks) using the parameter name as a list. For example, reference `params$name` within an R code block to print the year specified as a parameter or load the data specified as a parameter by referencing `data <- read_rds(params$data)` within an R code block.

Much like the rule-of-thumb regarding functions (i.e., if you have to copy and paste more than twice, create a function), if you find yourself copying and pasting a value that you may need to update (or change to create a report for a different audience), add it as a parameter.

#### References

We can specify a bibliography in the header:

```
---
title: "Research Assistant Training"
format: gfm
bibliography: references.bib
params:
  name: "Analytics"
  data: "analytics_data.rds"
---
```

We can can use the bibliography `references.bib` to include regular single-paper citations using `[@citation]` or multiple-paper citations using `[@citation; @citation]`, in-line citations using `@citation`, or citations without the Author using `[-@citation]`.

Additionally, each section and sub-section can be referenced by adding a `#sec` identifier to any heading and referencing `@sec`. For example, `## Introduction {#sec-intro}` would be referenced as `@sec-intro`.

#### Code Blocks

There are a variety of options for each code block. In addition to specifying the language used within the code block, the code block can be given an identifier, can have warnings suppressed, can run without producing output, etc. These options are specified using YAML syntax following the hashpipe operator `#|` within the body of the code block. Any code block option that should apply to the document in its entirety can simply be moved into the header.

#### Tables and Figures

Using Quarto means we can use Markdown, R, and LaTeX (along with other languages) interchangeably. While we can create a table using LaTeX or Markdown, we can also just print a data frame using `knitr::kable()` and the `{kableExtra}` package. The name of the code block is the given label that can be referenced, for example `#| label: tbl-planets` referenced with `@tbl-planets` (note that the `tbl-` prefix is required). For more table options, see the [kableExtra vignette](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf).

Similarly, we can include a figure using LaTeX, Markdown, or `knitr`. If `knitr::include_graphics()` is used, the name of the code block is the label that can be referenced, for example `#| label: fig-elephant`. If Markdown `![]()` syntax is used, the same label would be `{#fig-elephant}`. In either case, the figure would be referenced with `@fig-elephant` (note that the `fig-` prefix is required).

When Quarto creates a plot and other figures, by default they are stored in a badly named folder in the same directory as the Quarto document. Instead, we can modify the header to direct where created figures should be saved.

```
---
title: "Research Assistant Training"
format: gfm
bibliography: references.bib
params:
  name: "Analytics"
  data: "analytics_data.rds"
knitr:
  opts_chunk:
    fig.path: "../figures/"
---
```

The name of the figures will match the label of the code block in which it was created.

#### Equations

Equations are now supported when producing a GitHub document. Use `$` around any in-line LaTeX notation or `$$` around equations specified as a separate line. For example, we can reference $y^2$ as well as:

$$
y^2.
$$

## Project Organization

Each project has a similar organization. There are certain limitations on the size and type of files that can be pushed to GitHub. There are also certain things that shouldn't be accessible by the public (e.g., data we have a license to access). For these reasons, we have folders and files that are pushed to GitHub and those that are not. If you are starting a new project, please set up the repo using the [repo-template](https://github.com/marcdotson/repo-template).

### Pushed to GitHub

- `/code` Each script should do something specific (like tidyverse functions), have a descriptive name, and include number prefixes if they are meant to be run in a certain order (e.g., `01_import-data.R`, `02_clean-data.R`) and functions in `/code/src`.
- `/data` While all data live here, only data that are small enough and can be shared publicly will be pushed.
- `/figures` Figures live here, including images (saved as PNG files) and data referenced or used for tables, for use in the `README`, writing, and presentation.
- `/presentations` Slides for presentations (without any PDF knits).
- `/renv` Information on the reproducible environment (see below).
- `/writing` The paper (using the paper template but without any PDF knits) and case studies on specific aspects related to the project (with the output set to `gfm`).
- `.Rprofile` Information on the reproducible environment (see below).
- `README` The abstract and project organization details.
- `renv.lock` Information on the reproducible environment (see below).

### Not Pushed to GitHub

- `/output` Output from model runs. These files tend to be too large. They are also something each user can create on their own.
- `/private` A catch-all folder for additional files specific to a project that might not have anywhere else to live.

Note that you can create `/output` and `/private` folders in your local clone without worrying about them being pushed. We can further modify the `.gitignore` file to add other folders and files that aren't pushed to GitHub.

## Reproducible Environment

::: {.callout-caution}
The Reproducible Environment section is being worked on to also include Python-only virtual environments.
:::

Every package you install lives in your system library, accessible to all projects. However, packages change. Add a reproducible environment by creating a project library using the `{renv}` package.

- Initialize the project library once using `renv::init()`. This will create the `renv` folder (with its own `.gitignore`), a lockfile `renv.lock`, and an `.Rprofile` file.
- Once you've installed packages, add them to the project library using `renv::snapshot()`.
- To install the specific packages of an already-existing project library, use `renv::restore()`.
- To update all packages in the project library, call `renv::update()`. Make sure code is working with the updated packages before calling `renv::snapshot()` to update the lockfile.

::: {.callout-tip title="Non-Standard Repositories"}
If a package you're using has a non-standard repository (i.e., not on CRAN or another supported repository network), you'll need to update the `renv.lock` file to ensure the environment remains reproducible. When `renv::status()` runs it will tell you if a repository you downloaded a package from is non-standard and has difficulty tracking.

For example, for Stan packages, the R entry in the json `renv.lock` file will need to include:

```
{
  "R": {
    "Version": "4.3.1",
    "Repositories": [
      {
        "Name": "CRAN",
        "URL": "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest"
      },
      {
        "Name": "Stan",
        "URL": "https://mc-stan.org/r-packages"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
:::

Read [here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) for more on using `{renv}`, including creating and maintaining Python environments.

## Miscellaneous Details

- Use branches (never work on the main branch).
- Use `here::here()` to specify files paths within R scripts.
- Use tidyverse functions and the [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org) where possible.
